## Contribution Guidelines
## Development Workflow

1.  **No Direct Commits to Main**: The `main` branch is protected. Do not commit or push directly to it.
2.  **Branching Strategy**:
    - Create a new branch for every feature, bug fix, or improvement.
    - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/newFeature`).
3.  **Pull Requests**:
    - All changes must be submitted via a Pull Request (PR).

## Code Review Process

- **Review Requirement**: Every PR requires at least **one** code review approval before it can be merged.
- **Feedback**: Address all feedback and resolve conversation threads before merging.

## General Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- **Testing**: If applicable, ensure your changes are tested and do not break existing functionality.
- **Commits**: Write clear, concise commit messages.
